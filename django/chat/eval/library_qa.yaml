  responses: 
  - >
    To file a leave with income averaging request, you can follow these steps:
    1. Determine if your department or agency is serviced by the Public Service Pay Centre. If it is, you will need to complete an application for leave with income averaging.
    2. Get approval from your manager for the leave arrangement.
    3. Complete a pay action request (PAR) form.
    4. Send the completed application, along with the PAR form, to the Pay Centre at least 6 weeks before you would like to start your 12-month income averaging period.
    If your department or agency is not served by the Pay Centre, you will need to contact the Client Contact Centre, and they will refer your enquiry to your departmental compensation unit.
    It's important to note that the specific process may vary depending on your department or agency. Therefore, it is recommended to discuss leave options and requirements with your manager to ensure you have the correct information for your situation.

  responses: 
  - >
    To submit a maternity leave, you should follow these steps:

    1. Inform your employer: Notify your employer in writing about your intention to take maternity leave. It is important to do this at least four weeks before the initial date of continuous leave of absence while termination of pregnancy is expected to occur, unless there is a valid reason why the notice cannot be given.
    2. Provide necessary documentation: Your employer may ask for a medical certificate certifying your pregnancy. Make sure to provide any required documentation to support your maternity leave request.
    3. Discuss leave options: Talk to your employer about the different leave options available to you, such as paid maternity leave, unpaid leave, or a combination of both. Understand your rights and entitlements regarding maternity leave as per your company's policies and local laws.
    4. Plan your leave duration: Decide on the duration of your maternity leave. Some countries have specific laws regarding the minimum and maximum length of maternity leave. Discuss your preferred leave duration with your employer and come to an agreement.
    5. Coordinate with HR: Work closely with your company's HR department to ensure a smooth transition during your absence. Provide them with any necessary information or documentation they may require.
    6. Communicate with your team: Inform your colleagues and team members about your maternity leave plans. Discuss how your workload will be managed in your absence and delegate tasks accordingly.
    7. Follow company procedures: Follow any specific procedures or guidelines set by your company for submitting maternity leave requests. This may include filling out specific forms or providing additional information.

    Remember to consult your company's policies and local laws regarding maternity leave to ensure you are following the correct procedures.

  responses: 
  - >
    To calculate performance pay, you need to follow the guidelines provided in the performance pay administration plan. The plan outlines the percentages of salary that can be awarded for different levels of performance. For example, employees who "Exceed" expectations can receive up to 7% of their salary as a performance award, while those who "Fully Meet" expectations can receive up to 4.6% of their salary.
    It's important to note that performance awards are only paid out once a year. Additionally, there are exceptions and limitations outlined in the plan that need to be considered when calculating performance pay. For example, employees on leave without pay for the full fiscal year are not eligible for any performance increase, and employees in acting status may be eligible for performance pay at the higher level under certain conditions.
    Overall, the calculation of performance pay involves determining the appropriate percentage based on the employee's level of performance and applying it to their salary."
