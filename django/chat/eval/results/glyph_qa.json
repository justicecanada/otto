For example, the grapheme \u27e8\u00e0\u27e9 requires two glyphs: the basic a and the [grave accent](/wiki/Grave_accent \"Grave accent\") `. In general, a diacritic is regarded as a glyph,[[2]](#cite_note-Whistler_et_al-3) even if it is contiguous with the rest of the character like a [cedilla](/wiki/Cedilla \"Cedilla\") in [French](/wiki/French_language \"French language\"), [Catalan](/wiki/Catalan_language \"Catalan language\") or [Portuguese](/wiki/Portuguese_language \"Portuguese language\"), the [ogonek](/wiki/Ogonek \"Ogonek\") in several languages, or the stroke on a Polish \"[\u0141](/wiki/%C5%81 \"\u0141\")\". Although these marks originally had no independent meaning, they have since acquired meaning in the field of mathematics and computing, for instance.\n\nConversely, in the languages of Western Europe, the [dot](/wiki/Tittle \"Tittle\") on a lower-case \u27e8i\u27e9 is not a glyph in itself because it does not convey any distinction, and an \u27e8\u0131\u27e9 in which the dot has been accidentally omitted is still likely to be recognized correctly. However, in [Turkish](/wiki/Turkish_language \"Turkish language\") and adjacent languages, this dot is a glyph because that language has two distinct versions of the letter _i_, [with](/wiki/%C4%B0 \"\u0130\") and [without a dot](/wiki/Dotless_I \"Dotless I\"). \n\nIn Japanese [syllabaries](/wiki/Syllabary \"Syllabary\"), some of the characters are made up of more than one separate mark, but in general these separate marks are not glyphs because they have no meaning by themselves. However, in some cases, additional marks fulfil the role of [diacritics](/wiki/Diacritic \"Diacritic\"), to differentiate distinct characters. Such additional marks constitute glyphs. \n\nSome characters such as \"[\u00e6](/wiki/%C3%86 \"\u00c6\")\" in [Icelandic](/wiki/Icelandic_language \"Icelandic language\") and the \"[\u00df](/wiki/%C3%9F \"\u00df\")\" in [German](/wiki/German_language \"German language\") may be regarded as glyphs. They were originally typographic [ligatures](/wiki/Ligature_(writing) \"Ligature (writing)\"), but over time have become characters in their own right; these languages treat them as unique letters. However, a ligature such as \"fi\", that is treated in some typefaces as a single unit, is arguably not a glyph as this is just a design choice of that typeface, essentially an [allographic](/wiki/Allograph \"Allograph\") feature, and includes more than one [grapheme](/wiki/Grapheme \"Grapheme\").[[2]](#cite_note-Whistler_et_al-3) In normal handwriting, even long words are often written \"joined up\", without the pen leaving the paper, and the form of each written letter will often vary depending on which letters precede and follow it, but that does not make the whole word into a single glyph.", "[Jump to content](#bodyContent)From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaPurposeful written markThis article is about the typographical term.

For example, the grapheme \u27e8\u00e0\u27e9 requires two glyphs: the basic a and the [grave accent](/wiki/Grave_accent \"Grave accent\") `. In general, a diacritic is regarded as a glyph,[[2]](#cite_note-Whistler_et_al-3) even if it is contiguous with the rest of the character like a [cedilla](/wiki/Cedilla \"Cedilla\") in [French](/wiki/French_language \"French language\"), [Catalan](/wiki/Catalan_language \"Catalan language\") or [Portuguese](/wiki/Portuguese_language \"Portuguese language\"), the [ogonek](/wiki/Ogonek \"Ogonek\") in several languages, or the stroke on a Polish \"[\u0141](/wiki/%C5%81 \"\u0141\")\". Although these marks originally had no independent meaning, they have since acquired meaning in the field of mathematics and computing, for instance.\n\nConversely, in the languages of Western Europe, the [dot](/wiki/Tittle \"Tittle\") on a lower-case \u27e8i\u27e9 is not a glyph in itself because it does not convey any distinction, and an \u27e8\u0131\u27e9 in which the dot has been accidentally omitted is still likely to be recognized correctly. However, in [Turkish](/wiki/Turkish_language \"Turkish language\") and adjacent languages, this dot is a glyph because that language has two distinct versions of the letter _i_, [with](/wiki/%C4%B0 \"\u0130\") and [without a dot](/wiki/Dotless_I \"Dotless I\"). \n\nIn Japanese [syllabaries](/wiki/Syllabary \"Syllabary\"), some of the characters are made up of more than one separate mark, but in general these separate marks are not glyphs because they have no meaning by themselves. However, in some cases, additional marks fulfil the role of [diacritics](/wiki/Diacritic \"Diacritic\"), to differentiate distinct characters. Such additional marks constitute glyphs. \n\nSome characters such as \"[\u00e6](/wiki/%C3%86 \"\u00c6\")\" in [Icelandic](/wiki/Icelandic_language \"Icelandic language\") and the \"[\u00df](/wiki/%C3%9F \"\u00df\")\" in [German](/wiki/German_language \"German language\") may be regarded as glyphs. They were originally typographic [ligatures](/wiki/Ligature_(writing) \"Ligature (writing)\"), but over time have become characters in their own right; these languages treat them as unique letters. However, a ligature such as \"fi\", that is treated in some typefaces as a single unit, is arguably not a glyph as this is just a design choice of that typeface, essentially an [allographic](/wiki/Allograph \"Allograph\") feature, and includes more than one [grapheme](/wiki/Grapheme \"Grapheme\").[[2]](#cite_note-Whistler_et_al-3) In normal handwriting, even long words are often written \"joined up\", without the pen leaving the paper, and the form of each written letter will often vary depending on which letters precede and follow it, but that does not make the whole word into a single glyph.", "<headings>References</headings>\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Glyph&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4 \"Edit section: References\")]1. __[^](#cite_ref-1)__ Ilene Strizver.
