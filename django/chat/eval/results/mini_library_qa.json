reached between the Employer and the Public Service Alliance of Canada in respect of employees in the Program and Administration Services, Operational Services, Technical Services, Border Services and Education and Library Science bargaining units.\n\nThe PSAC\u00a0\u2013 TBS Joint Learning Program (JLP) will continue to provide joint training on Union management issues.\n\nStarting on the first day of the month following the date of signature of the PA collective agreement, the Employer agrees to increase monthly funding to the PSAC\u00a0\u2013 TBS JLP by a percentage equivalent to the annual base economic increase.\n\nStarting on the first day of the month following the date of signature of this agreement and for a two-year period, the Employer further agrees to provide fifty thousand three hundred and twenty-five dollars ($50,325) per month (for a total of $1.2 million) to fund a time-limited project to provide training tailored to the learning needs of occupational health and safety committees and representatives. For clarity, this temporary provision expires upon completion of the noted two-year period.\n\nThe PSAC\u00a0\u2013 TBS JLP will continue to be governed by the existing joint PSAC\u00a0\u2013 TBS Steering Committee. The Bargaining Agent Side Secretary on the National Joint Council will be invited to attend the meetings of the PSAC\u00a0\u2013 JLP Steering Committee with voice but no vote.", "<headings>Economics and Social Science Services (EC)</headings>\n__9.04__ A duly accredited representative of the Association may be permitted access to the Employer\u2019s premises, which includes vessels, to assist in the resolution of a complaint or grievance and to attend meetings called by management. Permission to enter the premises shall, in each case be obtained from the Employer. In the case of access to vessels, the Association representative upon boarding any vessel must report to the Master, state his or her business and request permission to conduct such business. It is agreed that these visits will not interfere with the sailing and normal operation of the vessels.\n\n__9.05__ The Association shall provide the Employer a list of such Association representatives and shall advise promptly of any change made to the list.\n\n__9.06__\n\n1. Subject to the availability of appropriate facilities, the Association may hold general meetings of the local membership on departmental premises.

The Alliance shall endeavour to avoid requests for posting of notices which the Employer, acting reasonably, could consider adverse to its interests or to the interests of any of its representatives. Posting of notices or other materials shall require the prior approval of the Employer except in the case of notices related to the business affairs of the Alliance, including posting of the names of Alliance representatives, and social and recreational events. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n__12.02__ The Employer will also continue its present practice of making available to the Alliance specific locations on its premises and, where it is practical to do so on vessels, for the placement of reasonable quantities of literature of the Alliance.\n\n\\*\\*", "<headings>External links</headings>\n| [Typeface classifications](/wiki/Typeface \"Typeface\") | | [Roman type](/wiki/Roman_type \"Roman type\") | * [Serif](/wiki/Serif \"Serif\") \t* [Antiqua](/wiki/Antiqua_(typeface_class) \"Antiqua (typeface class)\") \t* [Didone](/wiki/Didone_(typography) \"Didone (typography)\") \t* [slab serif](/wiki/Slab_serif \"Slab serif\") * [Sans-serif](/wiki/Sans-serif \"Sans-serif\") | | --- | --- | | [Blackletter type](/wiki/Blackletter \"Blackletter\") | * [Fraktur](/wiki/Fraktur \"Fraktur\") * [Rotunda](/wiki/Rotunda_(script) \"Rotunda (script)\") * _[Schwabacher](/wiki/Schwabacher \"Schwabacher\")_ | | [Gaelic type](/wiki/Gaelic_type \"Gaelic type\") | * [Insular](/wiki/Insular_script \"Insular script\") * [Uncial](/wiki/Uncial_script \"Uncial script\") | | Specialist | * [Record type](/wiki/Record_type \"Record type\") * [Display typeface](/wiki/Display_typeface \"Display typeface\") \t* [script](/wiki/Script_typeface \"Script typeface\") \t* [fat face](/wiki/Fat_face \"Fat face\") \t* [reverse-contrast](/wiki/Reverse-contrast_typefaces \"Reverse-contrast typefaces\") | |\n| [Punctuation](/wiki/Punctuation \"Punctuation\") ([List](/wiki/List_of_typographical_symbols_and_punctuation_marks \"List of typographical symbols and punctuation marks\")) | * [Bullet](/wiki/Bullet_(typography) \"Bullet (typography)\") * [Dash](/wiki/Dash \"Dash\") * [Hanging punctuation](/wiki/Hanging_punctuation \"Hanging punctuation\") * [Hyphen](/wiki/Hyphen \"Hyphen\") \t* [minus sign](/wiki/Hyphen-minus \"Hyphen-minus\") * [Interpunct](/wiki/Interpunct \"Interpunct\") * [Space](/wiki/Space_(punctuation) \"Space (punctuation)\") * [Vertical bar](/wiki/Vertical_bar \"Vertical bar\") |"], "faithfulness": 0.0, "correctness": 0.0, "p_sources_found": 0.0, "mostly_correct": false, "any_sources_found": false}, {"conversation": [{"user": "what services does the library provide"}], "expected_response": "The library provides various services, including research services such as finding legislative history or intent, preparing bibliographies, and assisting with legal citations.

tailored to the learning needs of occupational health and safety committees and representatives. For clarity, this temporary provision expires upon completion of the noted two-year period.\n\nThe PSAC\u00a0\u2013 TBS JLP will continue to be governed by the existing joint PSAC\u00a0\u2013 TBS Steering Committee.
